## Prerequisites
* A GitHub account
* Access to test design on inVision
* Access/a copy of the [website assets](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8lbgvkihdeidtk5/AAAws9r--tCp4Al04Y6R2M2Ga?dl=0)

## Exercise
Please style this static shop page following the given inVision design as closely as possible. You are free to change the code; use any frameworks; compilers and libraries you see fit but will be expected to explain why you chose to do so should you be invited for an interview. Any additional assets can be found on our [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8lbgvkihdeidtk5/AAAws9r--tCp4Al04Y6R2M2Ga?dl=0). You should submit your finished page as a pull request to this repository.

## What submissions will be tested on
* How accurately they were able to re-create the inVision design.
* Presentation on both desktop and mobile.
* The quality of their commit messages, pull requests and approach to branching.
* The quality of their code, including:
	- Naming conventions
	- Separation of concerns
	- Readability

The shop page's functionality is implemented using the angular framework. We expect you to be able to implement the design without breaking any functionality. We do not expect the basket or currency switching to work.

### Bonus:
In addition to submitting a pull request, you should try to host your webpage on an amazon S3 bucket and CloudFront CDN or free alternative. Please add the URL to this readme as part of the pull request.
